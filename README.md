# User Interface
## Color scheme
The colour scheme is inspired by the natural colours of the nature and the philosophical concept of Yin and Yang that describes opposite but interconnected forces. Here the black and white of the two forces symbolise the body and the soul. Yoga helps to build a bridge within the material and the etherial.

- The font utilised in the entire Project is Montserrat.
- Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface, with smooth and elegant waves that makes it aesthetically appealing.

A 404 page is a webpage displayed when a user attempts to access a non-existent or broken link on a website. The purpose of a 404 page is to inform the user that the requested page could not be found and provide options for them to navigate the website and find the information they were looking for. A well-designed 404 page can also help maintain a positive user experience by providing links to popular pages, a search bar, or a contact form for assistance.

# Future scope


# Bugs
### Problem:
In the footer of some pages, the menu buttons like "About Us" were pointing to a broken link.
### Solution:
To fix this, I updated the href value from "#about-us" to "index.html#about-us".
Additionally, I added a 404 error page for handling any potential broken links in the future.

### Problem:
To make the website responsive.
Whenever I attempted to make a section responsive, another section would lose its responsiveness.
### Solution:
My mentor suggested removing a majority of the margins and padding, and using flexbox as a solution.
