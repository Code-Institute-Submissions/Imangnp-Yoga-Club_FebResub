# User Interface
## Color scheme
The colour scheme is inspired by the natural colours of the nature and the philosophical concept of Yin and Yang that describes opposite but interconnected forces. Here the black and white of the two forces symbolise the body and the soul. Yoga helps to build a bridge within the material and the etherial. 
![colors](./assets/images/colors.png)

## Typography
- The font utilised in the entire Project is Montserrat.
- Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface, with smooth and elegant waves that makes it aesthetically appealing. 
- It is part of the Google font library [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

# Future scope

- Anchor elements will be added to the contact options text in the footer to make them clickable links for quick access.


# Bugs
### - Problem:
In the footer of some pages, the menu buttons like "About Us" were pointing to a broken link.
### Solution:
To fix this, I updated the href value from "#about-us" to "index.html#about-us".
Additionally, I added a 404 error page for handling any potential broken links in the future.

### - Problem:
To make the website responsive.
Whenever I attempted to make a section responsive, another section would lose its responsiveness.
### Solution:
My mentor suggested removing a majority of the margins and padding, and using flexbox as a solution.

### - Problem:
After creating a 404 error page on GitHub, it was not visible in the work place and pushing changes resulted error: "Updates were rejected because the remote repository contains work that is not present locally."
### Solution:
I perform a `git pull` in my local terminal prompt then performed `git config pull.rebase false`. That fetched the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them with the local version.
